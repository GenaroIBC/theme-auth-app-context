# Welcome!!

## Description

This is a simple project that i've made to learn about _React Context API_.

The main idea is to implement the following features:

1. Dark/Light theme
2. Authentication (simuled?)

and then refactorize it using _React Context_.

In this repo, you find the version of the app **with** _React Context_, and [here](https://github.com/GenaroIBC/theme-auth-app) you can find it without _Context_ implemented.
